### ðŸ¦† 42 Common Core Projects

| Project | Tools | Topics Covered | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RANK 05** |
| [Webserv](https://github.com/joseevilasio/webserv_42) | C++, Makefile | HTTP protocol, sockets, multithreading, request parsing | A fully functional HTTP server written from scratch in C++. Implements GET, POST and DELETE methods, CGI handling, and support for multiple clients using poll(). Inspired by NGINX behavior and RFC 2616. |
| [Inception](https://github.com/joseevilasio/inception_42) | Docker, NGINX, MariaDB, WordPress, Redis | Containerization, networking, system configuration | Built a mini infrastructure using Docker and Docker Compose to host multiple services (WordPress, MariaDB, NGINX, Redis) in isolated containers. Focused on network communication, volumes, and security configuration. |
| [C++ Modules](https://github.com/joseevilasio/piscine_cpp_42) | C++, Makefile | OOP fundamentals, templates, containers, STL | Introductory project to Object-Oriented Programming using the C++98 standard. Covers the main pillars of OOP in a structured and progressive way. |
| **RANK 04** |
| [C++ Modules](https://github.com/joseevilasio/piscine_cpp_42) | C++, Makefile | OOP fundamentals, classes, inheritance, polymorphism | Introductory project to Object-Oriented Programming using the C++98 standard. Covers the main pillars of OOP in a structured and progressive way. |
| [cub3D](https://github.com/joseevilasio/cub3d_42) | C, MiniLibX, Makefile | 2D graphics, raycasting, textures, basic game engine | A 3D maze game inspired by Wolfenstein 3D. We implemented a raycasting engine with wall collisions, sprite rendering, and interactive elements like doors and a minimap. Built in collaboration with [Mariana Morais](https://github.com/marianaobmorais). |
| [NetPractice](https://github.com/joseevilasio) | Network Simulator | Subnetting, routing, IP configuration | An interactive learning project focused on diagnosing and solving virtual network configurations. Designed to build intuition around IP addressing, routing tables, and network troubleshooting. |
| **RANK 03** |
| [minishell](https://github.com/joseevilasio/minishell_42) | C, Makefile | Shell parsing, token handling, process management, piping | A basic shell built from scratch, capable of handling commands, redirections, pipes, and heredocs. Emulates core features of Bash. Collaborated with [Mariana Morais](https://github.com/marianaobmorais). |
| [philosophers](https://github.com/joseevilasio/philosophers_42) | C, Makefile | Multithreading, synchronization, deadlock avoidance | Implementation of the classic Dining Philosophers problem using threads and mutexes. Focused on concurrency, resource sharing, and timing control. |
| **RANK 02** |
| [pipex](https://github.com/joseevilasio/pipex_42) | C, Makefile | UNIX pipes, I/O redirection, subprocess execution, heredocs | A simplified version of shell piping using child processes and file descriptor manipulation. Introduces fundamental system-level concepts. |
| [so_long](https://github.com/joseevilasio/so_long_42) | C, MiniLibX, Makefile | 2D game rendering, player input, map validation | A simple tile-based 2D game using a graphics library. Involves map parsing, event handling, and game state management. |
| [push_swap](https://github.com/joseevilasio/push_swap_42) | C, Makefile | Stack sorting, algorithm optimization, operations minimization | Program that sorts data using a limited set of stack operations. Focus on algorithm design and move efficiency. |
| **RANK 01** |
| [born2beroot](https://github.com/joseevilasio) | Debian, VirtualBox, Bash | Server setup, user permissions, network configs | Server configuration and Linux system hardening in a virtualized Debian environment. Includes firewall rules, partitions, and SSH setup. |
| [get_next_line](https://github.com/joseevilasio/get_next_line_42) | C | File I/O, buffer management, custom line reader | Implementation of a function to read from file descriptors one line at a time, without using standard library helpers. |
| [ft_printf](https://github.com/joseevilasio/ft_printf_42) | C, Makefile | Variadic functions, formatted output | Recreation of the `printf` function, handling various format specifiers and dynamic arguments. |
| **RANK 00** |
| [libft](https://github.com/joseevilasio/libft_42) | C, Makefile | C standard library, static linking | Creation of a personal C library that replicates key functions from `<string.h>` and other utilities. Foundation for later projects. |
